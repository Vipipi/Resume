%Project 1
%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\textcolor{emphasis}{\textbf{Global Trendy Application -} \textit{Website that recommends trendy news based on the user’s behavior}} 

\begin{itemize}
%  \item Developed frontend with Node.js and React, and used Express for backend’s web framework. Backend involves RESTful APIs
%design, non-symmetrical encryption, and decryption using salt and passport
%  \item Backend service included a scheduler to regularly import the latest news using NewsAPI, techniques involved MD5 hash to
%check duplicates with Redis as caches
%  \item Used web scraping techniques such as XPath and newspaper3K to fetch news data from well-known news websites. News will
%further be stored in MongoDB in JSON format before a similarity check using TF/IDF
%  \item Used CNN to train a model that can classify the type of the news, the model was first tested on Jupyter
%Notebook with TensorFlow.Estimator, techniques include eliminating stop words and stemmers, and using NLTK to tokenize
%sentences and vectorize words
%  \item Created a click log processor and used a time decay model to calculate user preference
% \item Techs: CNN, Node.js, ReactJS, passport, NewsAPI, MD5, Redis, MongoDB, Webscrapping, XPath, newspaper3K, JupyerNB, TF/IDF, NLTK, TensorFlow,Estimator, Time Decay Model, MVC
\item Front-end and back-end design
\item Created scheduler to fetch news data from popular medias
\item Generated news classification model using CNN
\end{itemize}

\textcolor{emphasis}{\textbf{Real-time Weather Data Processing System - } \textit{System that plot heatmap on Google Map in real-time} } 

\begin{itemize}
%  \item Exploited confluent/docker-image to create multiple docker containers for the purpose of single Kafka, producers,
%consumers, Redis, HBase, alternatively ZooKeeper
%  \item Built a Kafka queue cluster with ZooKeeper that is able to handle an enormous amount of data and have multiple layers for
%different topics
%  \item Used Sparks to calculate the average temperature from a data stream based upon specific batch size
%  \item Used Redis as cache to buffer the data before sending it to the Node server
%  \item Used socket.io to create a connection with React frontend and showed the result with google-map-react
% \item Techs: confluent/docker-image, Kakfa, Apache Hadoop, HBase, Zookeeper, Sparks, Map Reduce, socket.io, Redis, Node.js, google-map-react, ReactJS
\item Front-end and back-end design 
\item Created data stream framework with Kafka and Zookeeper
\item Average temperature calculating with Spark
\end{itemize}

\textcolor{emphasis}{\textbf{3D Surrounding Environment Scanner - } \textit{Scanner and environment that can show the model in real-time} } 

\begin{itemize}
\item Raspiberry Pi project
\item Used gyroscope and ToF sensors to detect angles and distances
\item Created 3D model and animated in real-time
